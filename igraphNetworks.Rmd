##Overview

  * R Tools for Network Analysis
      * igraph 
      * Rgraphviz

##Network Data Representations useful in R

  * graphNEL (node/edge list representation)
    * Easy to add/remove nodes and edges
  * graphAM (adjacency matrix)
    * Useful for permutations
  * igraph object (part of the igraph package)  

##The igraph package

  * R, Python and C implementations
  * Build and modify networks by nodes and edges
  * Extract subGraphs given nodes
    * Clique Detection
    * Community Detection algorithms (graphlets, random walk, etc)
  * Instantiate different background networks
    * Erdos-Renyi
    * Barabasi-Albert
  * Network Metrics
    * Centrality (PageRank, Hub)
    * Isomorphic Relations (Motif Finding)

##What you need to run these slides

I used the following libraries to generate these slides.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(igraph)
require(knitr)
```

##Loading in Data into igraph

The igraph package has parsers for reading in most of the general file formats for networks. Let's load in the Karate network from [Network Example Data](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/). It's in GML format, so we'll need to specify that when we use read_graph().

```{r}
library(igraph)
karate <- read_graph("data/karate.gml", format="gml")
class(karate)
plot.igraph(karate)

```

##Adding Labels and Improving the Layout

That's not very informative, especially since the original data doesn't have labels. Let's add some:

```{r}
get.vertex.attribute(karate, "id")
karate <- set.vertex.attribute(karate, "name", 
                               value=c("Chloe", "Emily", "Aaliyah", "Emma", 
                                       "Jennifer", "Olivia", "Hannah",
                                       "Jessica", "Sarah", "Lily", "Charlotte", 
                                       "Elizabeth", "Abigail", "Rebecca",
                                       "Samantha", "Jacob", "Muhammad", "Shawn", 
                                        "Aaron", "Daniel", "Jonah", "Alex", 
                                       "Michael", "James", "Ryan", "Jordan", 
                                       "Alexander", "Ali", "Tyler", "Kevin", 
                                       "Jack", "Ethan", "Luke", "Harry"))

#V() is a way to programmatically access vertices (or nodes) for igraph
V(karate)

#get the ids (as a vector)
V(karate)$name

#look at edges
E(karate)
```

##A More informative plot

```{r}
#layout example from https://rulesofreason.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/network-visualization-in-r-with-the-igraph-package/
plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold,	# the layout method. see the igraph documentation for details
        main='Karate Friends!',	#specifies the title
        #vertex.label.dist=0.5,			#puts the name labels slightly off the dots
        vertex.label.color='black',		#the color of the name labels
        vertex.label.font=1,			#the font of the name labels
        vertex.label=V(karate)$name,		#specifies the labels of the vertices. in this case the 'name' attribute is used
        vertex.label.cex=0.75,			#specifies the size of the font of the labels. can also be made to vary
        vertex.size=degree(karate)*1.5, #make node size proportional to number of connections
        edge.arrow.size=2
)
```

##Graph Attributes

Each element of a graph (vertices and edges) can be customized by passing in the appropriate attribute. For more info, check out [http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/igraph/docs/attributes](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/igraph/docs/attributes).

Some properties are automatically mapped, such as `V(graph)$color` or `E(graph)$color`. If you add a new attribute, you'll need to map this to a plotting property in `plot.igraph()`

Remember, that after changing graph properties, such as node size, you need to run your layout_ function again.

```{r}
#setting node properties
#can also use set.vertex.attributes() here
newKarate <- karate

faction <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 
                     1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
V(newKarate)$color <- faction

#Set edge attributes using E(accessor)
#can pass a named list for each node as well
#You can also use set.edge.attributes() here
E(newKarate)$color <- "red"

#Here we instantiate a weight vector using sample
weightvec <- sample(c(1,2,3,4), length(E(newKarate)), replace = TRUE)
#Name each edge
names(weightvec) <- E(newKarate)$name
weightvec
E(newKarate)$weight <- weightvec

#note we need to map an attribute to a property of the graph (igraph is dumb)
plot(newKarate, edge.width=E(karate)$weight)
```


##Simple Measures

Degree Distribution and Average Path Length

```{r}
degree(karate)
sort(degree(karate), decreasing = TRUE)
hist(degree(karate))
```

```{r}
average.path.length(karate)
shortPaths <- get.shortest.paths(karate, from="Muhammad")

plot(karate, mark.groups=shortPaths$vpath[c(10)])
```

##Drunken Stumbling

Let's generate a random walk from Jennifer and see where we get.

```{r}
w <- random_walk(karate, start = "Jennifer", steps =1000)

#who is the most visited?
sort(table(w$name), decreasing = TRUE)
#normalize table by number of visits
probKarate <- table(w$name)/1000
```

##Influencers

Who are the influencers (or hubs) in this social network? Let's use some network centrality measures to see. Are there any differences?

Who gives the highest correlation with our drunken walk probabilities?

```{r}
pr <- page.rank(karate)
sort(pr$vector, decreasing = TRUE)
nk <- V(karate)$name
cor(pr$vector[nk], probKarate[nk])

ec <- eigen_centrality(karate)
sort(ec$vector, decreasing = TRUE)
cor(ec$vector[nk], probKarate[nk])

hs <- hub_score(karate)
sort(hs$vector, decreasing = TRUE)
cor(hs$vector[nk], probKarate[nk])

```

##Cliques?

Who's the most connected groups to each other? Enquiring minds want to know...

```{r}
##get all cliques in the data
karateCliques <- cliques(karate)
length(karateCliques)

#let's try finding the largest cliques
largeKarateCliques <- largest_cliques(karate)
largeKarateCliques
```

##What are the Karate communities?

Can we split the network up into smaller communities? There are number of community detection algorithms we can use to see if we can cleanly separate our network into smaller modules, or communities.

```{r}
##Segment the karate network using the fast-greedy algorithm
fgComm <- fastgreedy.community(karate)
plot(fgComm, karate)

##Segment the karate network using the walktrap algorithm
wkComm <- walktrap.community(karate)
plot(wkComm, karate)

##how close are the algorithms?
compare(membership(fgComm), membership(wkComm))
```

##Extracting subgraphs from community membership

If there is a community of interest, we can use induced subgraph

```{r}
##extract the membership vector for the fastgreedy community
fgCommMembers <- membership(fgComm)

##let's extract the one of the cliques
clique1 <- induced.subgraph(karate, v=largeKarateCliques[[1]]$name)
plot(clique1)

#how many different communities are there?
levels(factor(fgCommMembers))

comm1 <- induced.subgraph(karate, fgCommMembers == 1)
plot(comm1)
```

##Other searches

How do we find all of Emma's friends?

```{r}
emmasNeighbors <- neighbors(karate, v="Emma", mode="all")
emmaSubnet <- c("Emma",emmasNeighbors$name)
emmaSubnet
emmaSubgraph <- induced.subgraph(karate, emmaSubnet)
plot(emmaSubgraph)
```

##Other Plot Layouts

igraph's built in plotting is not super customizable, but you can change layouts. All of the different igraph layouts begin with "layout_".

```{r}
#circle plot
plot(karate, layout=layout_in_circle)

#layout plot on grid
plot(karate, layout=layout_on_grid)

#force-directed layout for large graphs
plot(karate, layout=layout_with_lgl)

#layout plot with center (star layout)
plot(karate, layout=layout_as_star)

#layout plot on grid
plot(karate, layout=layout_with_dh)

```


##Generating graphs from scratch

Oftentimes, you will need to generate a bunch of graphs from scratch, for a background distribution or something. There are some built in functions to do that.

```{r}
#Random Graphs

rgGraph <- random.graph.game(34, p.or.m = 0.2)
plot(rgGraph)
hist(degree(rgGraph))
```

```{r}
#Erdos Renyi Graphs
erGraph <- erdos.renyi.game(34, 0.1)
plot(erGraph)
hist(degree(erGraph))
```

```{r}
#Barabasi graphs - power law distributed
bgGraph <- barabasi.game(34, 1)
plot(bgGraph)
#Confirm edge distribution is correct
hist(degree(bgGraph))
```

##A Background Distribution For Surrogate Mutations

How could we permute the nodes in a network while preserving overall structure?

##Dynamic Networks

If we preserve network layout, we can make simple movies that show how expression changes over time in reaction to a stimulus.

##Converting igraph Objects to Other Representations

The graph package (not the igraph package!) contains the graphNEL and graphAM representations. I don't really go into using them here, but just know that you can convert back and forth from these different representations using different commands.

```{r}
library(graph)
#graphNEL objects
karateGN <- igraph.to.graphNEL(karate)
karateGN
#Adjacency matrix
karateAM <- as(karateGN, "graphAM")
karateAM

#look at the actual adjacency matrix
karateAdjMat <- karateAM@adjMat
rownames(karateAdjMat) <- colnames(karateAdjMat)
rowSums(karateAdjMat)
colSums(karateAdjMat)
karateAdjMat
```

##Exporting out graphs

Sometimes you want to take your subgraphs and use a program like Cytoscape to make the visualization prettier.

The GML format will preserve most of your information.

## cyREST API

The cyREST API allows you to programatically transfer network data into Cytoscape. It's a bit quirky to set up and use, but once you set it up, you can transfer all network attributes (edge, node, and graph) that you've assigned to your GraphNEL objects directly into Cytoscape.

##Rgraphviz

  * Graphviz: mature package for network and graph visualization (AT&T)
  * Can define custom node graphics using viewports
  * Multiple Layouts
    * dot (hierarchical)
    * neato (force-directed, spring-model)
    * twopi (radial plots)
    * circo (circular graphs)
  * Clusters (subGraphs) for more control over the layout

##Custom Node Graphics + KEGGgraph + cluster layout in Rgraphviz

I used a combination of ggplot2 and Rgraphviz to plot time-series data on a pathway defined by KEGG. To get this to work, I had to define some clusters in the graph layout.

##Drawbacks to Rgraphviz

Graphviz is not guaranteed to give you the best layout - it can take a lot of customization and specification of clusters. You may want to take your networks into a tool such as Cytoscape that will let you customize your graph much more.
